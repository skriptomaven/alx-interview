## 0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix

In this projects I am tasked with implementing an in-place algorithm to rotate an n x n 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise.

## Concepts needed:

#### Matrix rep in Python:
- Understanding how 2D matrices are represented using lists of lists in Python.
- Accessing and modifying elements in a 2D matrix.
####  In-place operations:
- Performing operations on data without creating a copy of the data structure.
- The importance of minimizing space complexity by modifying the matrix in place.
#### Matrix Transposition:
- Understanding the concepts of transposing a matrix (swapping rows and columns).
- Implementing matrix transposition as a step in the rotation process.
#### Reversing Rows in a Matrx:
- Manipulating rows of a matrix by reversing their order as part of the rotation process.
#### Nested Loops:
- Using nested loops to iterate through 2D data structures like matrices.
- Modifying elements within nested loops to achieve the desired rotation.
