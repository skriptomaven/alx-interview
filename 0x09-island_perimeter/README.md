# Island Perimeter

The goal of this project to calculate the perimeter of a single island in a grid, where the grid is represented by a 2D array of integers.

## Concepts Needed:

####  2D Arrays (Matrices):
- Accessing and iterating over elements in a 2D array
- Understanding how to navigate through adjacent cells(horizontally & vertically)
#### Conditional Logic:
- Applying conditions to determine whether a cell contributes to the perimeter of the island
#### Counting Techniques:
- Developing a method to count the edges that contribute to the islands perimeter
#### Problem-Solving Strategies
- Breaking down the problem to count into smaller tasks, such as identifying land cells and calculating their contribution to the perimeter
#### Python Programming:
- Nested loops for iterating over grid cells
- Conditional statements to check the status of dajacent cells
