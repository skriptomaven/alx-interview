# Making Change

This project tackles a classic problem from the domain of dynamic programming
and greedy algorithms: the coin change problem: The objective is to find the
minimum number of coins required to make up a given total amount, given a list
of coin denominations. 

# Concepts:

## Greedy Algorithms
- Understanding how greedy algorithms work and why they are suitable for the coin change
- Recognizing the limitations of greedy algorithms & scenarios where they might not provide the optimal solution
## Dynamic Programming
- Basic principles of dynamic programming as a method to solve optimizing problems
- The concept of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure in the context of the coin change problem
## Algorithmic complexity
- Analyzing the time and space complexity of algorithms
- Striving for solutions with lower complexity to meet runtime constraints
## Problem-Solving Strategies
- Breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable sub-problems
- Iterate vs recursive approaches to dynamic programming
## Python Programming
- Manipulating lists and using list comprehensions
- Implementing functions with efficient looping & conditional statements
